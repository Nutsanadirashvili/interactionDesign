                           <h2><b>Process</b></h2>
                           <p>And the journey begins: we have one ESP32 (which has a touch sensor), one button, and one LED lamp. It's time to explore
                           and discover. For the first time, we tried to create some interesting interaction with the button and LED. However, we
                           soon realized that the state of the button did not allow us much manipulation, as it only had two states (on/off). We
                           wanted something more exciting that would make our LED more lively, so we decided to switch to touch sensing altogether.
                           I had never worked with a touch sensor before, so it was an explorative process for me. It turned out that the output of
                           the sensor returns a number that expresses the intensity of the touch. We soon realized that we should map this number
                           to the brightness of the LED, turning the interaction into a playful environment for more drama.
                              <br><br>
                              <b>Narrative:</b> The first idea was inspired by birthday cakes, which always have candles on them. We, people, are always
                              excited about the tradition of making a wish and blowing out the candles with great force to make the wish come true.
                              Drawing from this inspiration, we decided to use LEDs instead of candles and the intensity of touch instead of blowing
                              out. The instructions for users would be: "Make a wish, press the sensor hard to extinguish the LED, and your wish come
                              true.<br>
                              Another idea we had was a game called "Save Energy, Make Light." In this game, players would use the touch option to dim
                              their LED. However, they had to be careful not to press too hard, as that would cause the LED to go out. The player who
                              could maintain the LED at the darkest and strongest level for the longest time would be the winner. We chose the second
                              narrative because it introduced an element of competition, allowing us to compare the performance of different players.

                           <br><br>
                           <h2><b>Implementation</b></h2>
                           <p>In the first iteration, our focus was on implementing the functionality correctly. We designed the system so that when
                           the player touches the sensor (in this case, the cable), the brightness of the LED changes based on the intensity of the
                           touch. The higher the intensity, the less the LED lights up, and at a certain intensity value, the light disappears
                           completely. During the implementation, we realized that finding the ideal mapping point was challenging. We wanted to
                           strike a balance between a manageable task and a moderate level of difficulty to keep the player engaged. Although it
                           would have been beneficial to gather feedback at this stage, time constraints led us to make the decision on our own
                           regarding the optimal difficulty level.
                           <br><br>
                           In the next iteration, we introduced another component to the game: time. Players now had to maintain the low light
                           level for at least 3 seconds. What seemed like a simple addition turned into a significant challenge. We spent a
                           considerable amount of time debugging the code as we struggled to identify the causal relationships between different
                           variables and determine the appropriate code to achieve the desired output.
                           <br><br>
                           For the third iteration, we decided to change the rules of the game based on Marvin's suggestion. We implemented a
                           simple timer with a playtime of 10 seconds. At the end of each 10-second round, all the data was reset, and the counting
                           started anew. The touch intensity values accumulated during these ten seconds were summed and averaged. The winner was
                           determined by the highest average touch intensity.
                           <br><br>
                           In terms of usability, we observed that using a jumper cable was somewhat clumsy and unpredictable for the players. To
                           address this issue, we decided to create a small ball of foil as a contact point, which we attached to the tip of the
                           cable. This modification aimed to improve the player's experience and provide a more reliable touch interaction.
                           </p>

                           <h2><b>Outcomes</b></h2>
                           <p>We encountered a challenge where the touch intensity range would easily change if the cable was not securely fixed to
                           the ESP32. This issue affected the reliability of the touch interaction and could potentially impact the gameplay
                           experience.
                              <br><br>
                              Although we didn't fully implement the functionality to compare different players and determine a winner in our program,
                              we still found the interaction among the participants to be interesting. Most participants found the interaction
                              exciting because they had control over the LED brightness and could visually observe the immediate results of their
                              touch intensity. The action and reaction were instantaneous, with minimal perceivable delay between input and output.
                              This created a sense of live action and reaction, enhancing the engagement and enjoyment of the participants..
