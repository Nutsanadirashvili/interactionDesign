                           <h5><mark><b>Unusual Conditions</b></mark></h5>
                           <br>
                           <h4><b>Process</b></h4>
                           <p>As a group, we decided to explore a sensor that was unfamiliar to us and somewhat
                              unconventional for our task. We chose
                              a line detection sensor, which required us to familiarize ourselves with its physical
                              components and functional
                              capabilities. However, we found that the documentation for the sensor was rather dry and
                              uninformative.

                              The sensor documentation provided an example using a thin line, so we initially attempted
                              experiments using a regular
                              marker line. However, this proved to be a suboptimal idea. We discovered that the sensor
                              was not very accurate,
                              particularly when trying to detect a fine line, especially if it was in motion.

                              Given that the sensor worked based on the transmission and reception of infrared signals,
                              specifically by detecting
                              whether it encountered a reflecting or absorbing surface, we realized that we needed to
                              consider another crucial factor:
                              daylight. To address this, we constructed a small paper box to enclose the sensor,
                              creating a dark environment around
                              it. This allowed us to obtain more precise and delicate data.

                              Additionally, we discovered that the sensor's sensitivity could be adjusted theoretically
                              using a potentiometer,
                              offering potential control over its performance in different conditions.

                              <b>Narrative:</b> The initial idea we had for the line detection sensor involved creating
                              a simple game where a small car had
                              to follow specific predetermined lines on a map. The map would feature a starting point
                              and a finish line, and if the
                              car crossed any of the lines, it would be considered out of the game.

                              However, as we progressed with our work, we realized that the narrative of the game felt
                              somewhat mundane and
                              predictable. We wanted something more exciting and unconventional. So, we decided to
                              completely change our approach.
                              <br>
                              Instead of creating a game, we aimed to use the line detection sensor to represent an
                              ideaâ€”a concept that would
                              encourage us to think outside the box, embrace non-linear thinking, and embrace the
                              freedom of creativity. By shifting
                              our focus to this new narrative, we hoped to spark imagination and exploration beyond
                              traditional game mechanics.
                              <br><br>
                              
                           <h4><b>Implementation</b></h4>
                           <p>Due to the time constraints we were facing, we had to work on multiple aspects in
                              parallel. While the code was ready, we
                              needed to focus on the physical construction. </p>
                           <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" src="img/photo-14.jpeg" alt="Photo">
                           <p> We decided to create a larger car-like structure that could neatly house
                              all the required technology. The base of the car was a breadboard where we attached the
                              line detection sensor. On top of
                              the car, we positioned the LED, resembling a siren on a police car. Our intention was to
                              create a cohesive design with
                              these elements.
                              <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" src="img/test.png" alt="Photo">
                              However, we encountered a challenge with the power supply. The sensor required a minimum
                              of 3.3 volts to function, but
                              we couldn't find a suitable battery holder in stock. As a result, we had to use a cable
                              for the power supply instead.
                              <br>
                              The motion map for our car had a specific design. The car would start at the top,
                              symbolizing the beginning of life, and
                              attempt to move downwards. Along the way, there were black boxes, representing the
                              stereotypical fixed mindsets
                              prevalent in our society. These mindsets can create various obstacles throughout our
                              lives.

                              When the car entered one of these black boxes, the blue LED would light up, indicating
                              that we were inside the box. The objective of the game was to
                              minimize the number of times the car entered these black boxes and strive to navigate
                              outside the box for the entire
                              duration of the game.

                           <h2><b>Outcomes</b></h2>
                           <p>The fact that the participants couldn't see the sensor directly added an element of
                              excitement to the interaction. It
                              made it challenging for them to determine the exact trajectory of the car's movement,
                              adding an element of surprise and
                              unpredictability to the experience.
                              <br>
                              One interesting aspect was gathering feedback from participants about their
                              interpretations of the abstract figures on
                              the road map. It became evident that not everyone had the same associations or
                              understanding of the symbolism presented.
                              This diversity of interpretations added depth and richness to the overall experience.
                              <br>
                              To enhance the user-friendliness of the interaction, it would have been beneficial to
                              incorporate moving wheels on the
                              car. This visual feedback would have provided participants with a clearer sense of the
                              car's motion, further immersing
                              them in the experience.
                           </p>
