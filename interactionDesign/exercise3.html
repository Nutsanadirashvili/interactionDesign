                           <h2><mark><b>Unsusual Relation</b></mark></h2>
                           <br>
                           <h2><b>Process</b></h2>
                           <p>For our final task, we had the freedom to choose any interaction we wanted, as long as it
                              was unusual. We found Daniel's
                              suggestion of using a laptop with movement and balance intriguing, and we decided to
                              explore that direction. We wanted
                              to take something familiar and common in our everyday lives and transform it into an
                              unusual interaction. That's when we
                              thought of the mouse.

                              To make the typical mouse interaction unusual, we drew inspiration from the concept of
                              Chindogu, which involves creating
                              impractical, yet thought-provoking inventions. We decided to design a large artifact that
                              would move the cursor on the
                              screen by tilting it, adding complexity and unpredictability to the interaction.
                              <br><br>
                              <b>Narattive:</b> In the distant future, where AI reigns and humans are plagued by a sense
                              of idleness, the AI recognizes the urgent need
                              to revive human engagement and creativity. Searching through the annals of history for
                              inspiration, the AI stumbles upon
                              an intriguing solution.
                              <br>
                              <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" src="img/old.png" alt="Photo">
                              It decides to create a completely novel form of interaction to reignite the spark within
                              humanity. The solution it finds is the creation of an extraordinary artifact—an enormous
                              cursor that defies convention. This
                              cursor, unlike any before it, requires the collaborative effort of a select few
                              individuals to operate. The AI
                              understands that without group involvement, humans will be unable to utilize this colossal
                              cursor and, consequently,
                              access the digital realm.

                           <h2><b>Implementation</b></h2>
                           <p>For our unconventional interaction, we opted to use a 6-Axis Accelerometer & Gyroscope
                              sensor. I was familiar with this
                              sensor, I knew there could be potential challenges. But we didn't have another sensor
                              available on-site to accurately
                              measure tilt. Leveraging Henning's experience with microPython, our initial plan involved
                              using an ESP32 and connecting
                              the gyroscope via a serial interface with microPython to transmit mouse signals directly
                              to the computer. However, the
                              implementation proved to be quite difficult, and we encountered several roadblocks,
                              leading to the failure of this plan.
                           </p>
                           <br>
                           <p>
                              We turned to the internet in search of alternative solutions. We came across the idea of
                              cursor control via a serial
                              path using an Arduino mouse control library. However, we hit another obstacle—our ESP
                              model was not compatible with the
                              Arduino library. Eventually, Marc discovered a successful approach recommended by Konrad
                              and Kiel. We utilized a node
                              server and the JavaScript library robot.js to establish a wireless connection. The raw
                              data from the gyroscope sensor
                              was transmitted via W-LAN to a computer running the node server. We then mapped this data
                              to mouse movement, enabling us
                              to control the cursor based on the sensor's readings.
                              <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" src="img/sensor.gif" alt="Photo">
                              However, interpreting the sensor
                              data presented its own
                              significant challenge. The gyroscope provided acceleration data instead of direct degrees
                              of tilt, requiring us to apply
                              complex mathematical formulas to interpret the data as tilt or coordinates.
                           </p>
                           <br>
                           <p>
                              In addition to the technical considerations, we also needed a physical artifact for
                              interaction. We quickly agreed on
                              the visual concept of a large, pixelated cursor resembling an old-fashioned arrow. To
                              bring this idea to life, we
                              utilized the largest hard cardboard available and used a laser cutter to cut out the
                              desired cursor shape. Styrofoam was
                              then used to secure and reinforce the structure.
                              <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" src="img/photo-18.png" alt="Photo">
                              While initially planning for a single
                              large button in the middle of the
                              cursor, we realized during the prototyping phase that it would disrupt the cursor's visual
                              aesthetics. As a result, we
                              opted for an interactive cursor tip covered of foil and incorporated a touch sensor,
                              allowing users to touch and click
                              the cursor tip to initiate actions.

                           <h2><b>Learnings</b></h2>
                           <p>After completing the construction and conducting tests on our artifact, we were thrilled
                              to discover that we had created
                              an incredibly captivating and enjoyable interaction. Observing individuals using the giant
                              cursor gave the impression of
                              being a surfer, skillfully riding the waves of the web.
                              <br><br>
                              potential extensions to further enhance the interaction: One intriguing idea was to
                              incorporate a light element, such as
                              a Light Stripe, to provide visual feedback when the user clicks or interacts with elements
                              on the screen.
                              <img class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" src="img/photo-19.jpeg" alt="Photo">
                              It would be intriguing to explore the dynamics of controlling an even larger and heavier
                              cursor, reaching a point where
                              it becomes impossible for a single person to operate it alone. In such a scenario, it
                              raises questions about how users
                              could collaboratively control the cursor, how they would communicate with each other, and
                              how efficiently they would
                              work together to achieve their shared goal.
